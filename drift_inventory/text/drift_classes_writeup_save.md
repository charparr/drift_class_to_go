# Drift Classification

## Methods

Binary snowdrift masks were computed for each snow depth map (N=12) by applying our threshold snowdrift depth method (Figure __ Table _) to each map. From these masks we manually delineated 59 snowdrifts with high fidelity (similarity?). Then, using the snowdrift mask, a topographic hillshade map, and snow-free imagery, we classified each snowdrift based on its geography (not its snow) as one of six distinct types: water track (22), stream (7), polygon (12), outcrop (5), lake (7), and "other" (6). Each class is associated with a distinct landscape feature, and together (based on our field knowledge) are representative of variety of snowdrift features found throughout the two domains.

## Snowdrift Types

### Water track

Water tracks (c.f. McNamara et al.,  1998; Paquette et al., 2017) are hillslope water drainage pathways that are common in permafrost regions and include a broad range of geomorphic, soil, and vegetation characteristics (Trochim et al., 2016). Water track snowdrifts are abundant with HV and CLPX. The size and depth of an individual watertrack is limited by water availability (width) and permafrost (depth) - and so frequently create filling (a.k.a. Equilibrium or complete) snowdrifts. While a set of near-parallel hilllslope watertracks may all fill, they likely do so at different points throughout the winter because of the neighbor effects of an upwind snow trap - downwind water tracks within in a certain fetch of an upwind, not-filled neighbor will be starved for flux (only receiving precipitation and the flux from the intermediary interfluve scour zone) until the upwind neighbor reaches an equilibirum profile. It is possible this pattern of fill (integrated flux vs. easting) also influences the growth of the water track itself (nivation). 

### Polygon

Polygon snowdrifts occur in the ice wedge degradation troughs and may be found throughout an area of polygonal ground. The higher polygon centers are exposed to scour and snow is trapped beteen polygons. While polygonal features less abundant in our two domains, they are representative of large nearby stretches of Alaska's coastal plain (REFs (e.g. 1002 one)). Like watertracks, these snowdrifts are limited in size by the landscape (inter-polyon crack size depends on ice wedge degradation) and so they too frequently fill with snow. Networks of connected polygon snowdrifts are common and they unlikely to occur in isolation - meaning their filling rate is influenced by upwind neighbors as well. 

###

Stream snowdrifts line the banks of drainage channels but are larger and can include beaded streams, glacial rivers, and meandering creeks. While the width of stream drifts can range from several to hundreds of meters and thus overlap with watertracks of the same dimension, they are distinguished by having a steeper cutbank (from greater erosionand channel incision) than watertracks. Stream drifts may or may not reach equilibrium depending on the size of the catchment and the amount of flux. The ulimate stream snowdrift profile is also

determined by whether or not the windward positive break in slope (e.g. the far cutbank) is creating a secondary rotor in which snow settles out. For sufficiently large snowdrifts (e.g. Meade River, Benson & Sturm (1993) this "blowback" affect is absent, but for smaller streams contributes strongly to drift geometry (e.g. Put River?, REF?). The outcrop drifts lie in the lee of exposed sedimentary rocks (geol. map) left behind by the __ glaciation. Occuring only in the CLPX domain, the outcrop drifts have often have a steep or cliff leeward face which triggers the snowdrift and may have a similar feature (and drift) on the windward side as well. Lake drifts, once filled, often form smooth 'aprons' sloping downward from the upwind break in slope toward the lake ice itself. Unfilled lake drifts may be far more dramatic (Fig. of Lake). Many lake drifts are tightly coupled with conjugate score zones. How does relatively poor sintering on lake ice impact lake drift tails? Finally, the "other" drifts have no obvious nearby features that aid interpretation. They lack a clear flow separation point, yet they occur most frequently on mild hillslopes of only a few degrees.

Results of all snowdrifts are in figure:

There are two functional relationships between drift type and snow: the volume-area ratio (VAR) (Figure __) and the coefficient of variance (CV) of snow depth (Figure __). These factors help us understand 1) the volume of snow each type of drift typically traps normalized by the size of the feature, and 2) how variable snow depth is within the drift normalized by the mean depth. From these relationships we see a general trend between filling and nonfilling snowdrifts. Where VAR <= about 1 we see filling drifts: small watertracks and polygon drifts. Where most VAR values

## Discussion

Some Drifts Fill more than others.


Discussion: Is there a relationship between max. VA ratio and equilibirum profile:
Construct artificial EQ drift and what is the va ratio and what is the slope?

Can area predict VAR? Is it different for filling vs. nonfilling?

What is the cutoff distance where wind no longer positive slope (far riverbank) has influence?

Manually delinateing drifts is efficient although not easily automated. The need for topographic and geographic map interpretation, as well as the highly connected nature of snowdrifts (as they are related to hydrography) makes automatically separating and classifying drift types difficult. A more concerted automatic classifying effort could make progress using geomorphometry and hydrographic data.
