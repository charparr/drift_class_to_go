# Drift Snow Patterns and Topography: An Arctic Investigation

## Abstract

## Introduction
Distinct spatial patterns of snow properties (depth, density, hardness) are common in nature and occur across spatial scales ranging from continental (10<sup>6</sup> m, e.g. snow classes (Sturm et al., 1995)), to regional (10<sup>5</sup> m, e.g. glacier facies (Benson, 1962)), to local (e.g. 10 m snow bedforms). The processes that produce these patterns function over years (climate patterns) to hours, with surprisingly rapid pattern development possible in windy locations where snow transport rates can exceed decigrams/m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Not surprisngly, some of the most distinctive snow patterns are found in tundra and prairie snow classes, where wind transport is frequent. These tundra prairie snow patterns reflect the spatial arrangements of two elements (or facies): snow drifts, the "sinks" for windblown snow, and scour zones, the sources.

The snow patterns produced by these elements are important because drifts provide runoff in the summer long after the rest of the snow cover is gone. On the tundra, this delayed runoff occurs when the seasonally frozen ground has thawed, allowing meltwater to infiltrate the soil. Drifts also incrase the overall amount of water storeed across a landscape because once stockpiled in a drift, snow is removed from the transport system and protected from the high sublimation rates that accompanty blowing snow (e.g. up to 47% of the annual snowfall is lost to sublimation (Essery et al., 1999; see also Pomeroy at al., 1997; Listion and Sturm, 1998)). Recent work in the Himalaya (Stigter et al., 2018) indicates a strong anti-coorrelation between the spatial distribution of sublimation magnitude and the distribution of drifts.

In tundra and prairie snow covers the connections between snow, wind transport, and topography are tight (Figure 1), yet surprisingly complex. A key difficulty is that the snow "available" to drift differs from the amount of snow present. That latter amount is the algebraic sum of winter precipitation (*P*) minus (or plus) snow already transported, less sublimated snow (*S*), and less the snow trapped by vegetation (*V*). The amount available for transport is limited by how much is prsent, but also controlled by the wind shear stress, whuch must exceed the surface snow adhesion before transport will occur. Since adhesion varies with sintering, a process affected by snow age, the end result is that predicting the actual flux can be quite difficult even when quality meterological data is present - a condition lacking for much of the windy, snow-covered regions of the Earth. It is not surprising, therefor, that prior studies have docuemented a 10X range in transport rates at any given wind speed (Sturm and Stuefer, 2013).

The relationship between transport and topography (gullies, river cutbanks, hillslopes, ridgelines, etc.) is simpler: snow is deposited wherever the separation angle between wind streamlines and ground slope is sufficient to produce a local reduction in wind shear. The finer details of this relationship are complicated and turbulent, for when wind blows over complex topography eddies, rotors, and turning of the wind occurs. Such wind patterns can be hard to visualize and even harder to model, yet they affect drift geometry. Additionaly, as drifts grow and change through the winter, so do the wind fields around them. Wind-blown snow does not travel the same landscape twice.

But at an even more basic level, we lack fundamental statistical information about drifts and topography. For example, in what sort of topography does the maxiumum proportion of snow accrue in drifts? At watershed, regional, or global scales, how much of the winter snowfall is stockpiled in drifts?[^1] Doest it vary widely with amount of wind and snow?

In this paper, using eight years of aerial photogrammetric and lidar snow depth mapping covering over a hundered square kiolmeters of tundra snow in northern Alaska (Figure 2), we explore the drift-topography relationship (Figure 1) and produce a drift census. Of particular interest is the extent to which the individual drifts take on the same geometry year after year (similarity), and how stable over time existing landscape patterns of scour and drift are likely to be (fidelity). While our study falls short of being a regional census, the results suggest that drifts in this sector of the Arctic can lock up nearly 40% of the snow water equivalent (SWE) each winter and therefore warrant attention.

## Background
Historically, drift studies have taken either a profile or a planimetric perspective. Engineers, faced with preventing rails and roads from being buried by drift (*cf.* Moore, 1922) sought optimal road cut designs, usually prsented in cross section (i.e. profile). Finney (1939), based on a combination of wind tunnel experiments and direct observations, concluded that for slopes greater than 14 degrees wind eddies would form and drift deposition occured. Rikhter (1954) and Kuz'min (1963) explored this topic and drift trap geometry further, and that work culminated in 1975 when Tabler, on the basis of 17 profiles measured in Wyoming and Colorado, developed an empirical drift profile regression model based on upwind and downwind surface slopes. He also introduced the term 'equilibrium profile' to describe the shape of the surface of a snowdrift that cannot grow any further because the deposited snow has filled the catchment and eradicated the separation angle necessary for drifting. Tabler's equilirium and non-equilbirum drifts are analgous to Cornish's (1902) complete vs. incomplete drift classification (defined using profile diagrams) and also equate with the filling or non-filling drifts descbribed by Sturm and Benson (1993). Recognizing (as did Cornish and Tabler) that if a drift was not filled, it could be used to measure the total winter flux, Benson (1981) began an annual series of surveys to monitor drift volume in NW Alaska that has been continued sporadically since then.

The planimetric (mapping) approach has generally been used to understand the distribution and prevalence of drifts on the landscape. Kirnbaur (1991), Konig and Sturm (1998), Grayson et al. (2002), Winstral et al. (2002), and Parajka at al. (2012) all used aerial surveys to map drifts. A few studies (Klapa, 1980; Lauriol et al., 1986; Watson et al., 1994) have tried using aerial photos to conduct a drift census, seeking to use drifts as wind/precipitation climte indicators. Several studies using a plainmetric approach (Luce and Tarboton 2004; Sturm and Wagner, 2010; Qualls and Arogundade, 2013) have attempted to quantify the interannual similarity and fidelity of the drift patterns using map-based approaches.

Combing planimetric and profile appraoches has been hampered by three things. First is the lack of a quantititative definition of what constitutes a drift, which we address later. Second has been the inability to map drift depth when working in the planimetric mode. Until recently, depth has had to be measured manually, limited sample size and extensive drift inventories. Third, we have lacked sophisticated tools for quanitfying drift similarity (or lack thereof).

Fortunately, we can now map drift depths over large areas uing airborne lidar or SfM techniques (REFS), and similar mapping is becoming possible using satellites (REF). More robust methods of comparing spatial similarity have been developed, in large measure due to computer security needs (Jetten, 2003, check REF). In the past, these comparisons have been sensitive to small differences in images, obscuring larger similarities (Wang and Bovik, 2005). Minor geometric distortions and signal noise (common in any remote sensing product) tended to produce low similarity scores (compared to human observers) even when patterns were similiar, but modern algorithms (REFS) have largely rectified this problem.

## Field Area
Each winter between 2012 and 2018 (except 2014) we mapped the snow depth across two swaths of the Kuparuk and Sagavanirktok watersheds of Arctic Alaska (Figure 3). Physiographically these swaths lie in the foothills province of the Brooks Range and span two types of terrain: (1) undulating, broad piedmont hills (typified by Imnavait Basin) with abundant water tracks, and (2) more rugged and rocky terrain with cliff bands. Field areas are entirely tundra-covered with some shrub tundra and larger shrubs in riparian zones. The snow cover (ecluding drifts) in the region tends to be thin (< 0.6 m), comprised of six to ten layers, forms in September and lasts through May (see Benson and Sturm, 199_). Basal layers of depth hoar fill the inter-tussock spaces and are typically capped by one or more wind slabs. Prevailing winter winds come from the south in the CLPX swath, and from the west in the HV swath. Snowdrifts develop in water tracks, along river and stream cutbanks, along the edges of lakes, and below outcrops of flat-lying or slight dipping sedimentary rocks. Prior information on drifts in the area can be found in Sturm et al., 1995; Sturm and Wager, 2011; Liston?; Walker?.

## Snow Depth Mapping Methods
Snow depth mapping was done using SfM photogrammetry (2015 though 2018) or lidar (2012, 2013) and then adjusted to ground-based measurements. The area mapped covered about 150 km<sup>2</sup> each year. We conducted: (1) airborn surveys of the snow-free surface in June which were used to produce a digital elevation model (DEM) of each swath, (2) airborne surveys of near-peak snow cover in April that were used to create digital surface models (DSMs) of the snow surface over the swaths. We then generated high resolution (1 m) snow depth maps by subtracting the DEM from the snow-covered DSMs. Six such depth maps were produced for each swath between 2012 and 2018 (save 2014), comprising over 600 million individual geospatial snow depth records. The hardware, software, and processing steps used to go from the airborne survey data (photos or lidar returns) is described in Nolan et al., 2015, King et al., 2019, and others (REFS). Data is available at WEBSITE.

Acquiring the DEM was problematic because tundra plants often leaf out before snowdrifts completely melt out. We acquired an initial DEM using airborne lidar in 2012 and a second DEM using SfM in 2017. Both were acquired in early June, but in 2017 remnant snowdrifts covered some import parts of the field area. The 2017 DEM, however, was derived from a denser point cloud and therefore better where not obscured by snow. The two DEMs were fused together to leverage their respective strengths.

The six snow depth maps for CLPX and HV were validated and adjusted using 141,207 direct probe measurements of snow depth collected concurrently with the airborne surveys (Fig __ and Appendinx , also Deems et al., 2013, Westoby et al., 2013, Currier at al, 2019). Differences between snow depth maps (raster data) and field probe measurements (vector data) arise from errors in converting point clouds to gridded surface models and from geolatocation errors in both sets of data. The probe measurements, which use a WAAS-corrected GPS, have a positional uncertainty of ± 2.5 m and a quasi-random vertical depth uncertainty ranging from 0 to 0.05 m caused by a tendency to 'over-probe' down into the subtrate below the snow (Sturm and Holmgren, 2018). The DEMs and DSMs have a position uncertainty estimated to be ± 0.30 m (Nolan et al., 2015), resulting in snow depth pixel locations accurate to about ±0.4 m. Without correcting either pixel or probe positions, we overlaid and differenced the two emasurement sets for each swath and survey (Fig __ and Table __). Mean differences ranged from -0.06 m to 0.40 m (mean = 0.16 m: Fig __). As described by Nolan, we applied a global affine transformation to reduce the mean probe-minus-raster value for each survey to zero. This offset arises the combination of positional and vertical errors, as well as 'pink' noise in the GPS signals over the course of the airborne surveys (refs ?). Once adjusted, the resulting snow depth maps have been shown to be accurate to about ±0.1 m, which with respect to delineating drifts (which are easily 20 time deeper) is insignificant. The resulting accuracy of the maps is comparable to that of other airborne (e.g. Deems et al., 2008; Deems et al., 2013; Jagt at al., 2015; Nolan et al., 2015, Buhler, Harder, Painter) and spaceborne (Marti et al) snow depth mapping efforts.

## Results
### A Snowdrift Census
The twelve snow depth maps from CLPX and HV (six each) are shown in Figure ___, with all maps viewable in higher resolution at: LINK TO GITHUB STATIC SITE. Using these maps we have delineated 59 snowdrifts in order to enable a snowdrift census - but this required defining a snowdrift that can be automated and take into account the variability of each snow season. Simply put, a drift is an aera where there has been an additional accumulation of snow deposited by wind - not precipitation. But how much? Researchers easily recognize drifts[^2] , but that identification relies on layered spatial information including geometry, texture, and shadowing, factors that may be difficult to account for in remote sensing products. Here we define the drifts in an area of interest (AOI) using a snow depth threshold determined by testing the response of two functions of the threshold: the percentage area of the AOI covered by drifts (% DA), and the percentage of total snow volume in the AOI contained in the drifts (%DV). To ilustrate how % DV and % DA change and the method for an ROI of extent greek (m) we use a normal snow depth distribution with a mean (mu) of.5 m and a standard deviation (sigma) of 0.2 m (Matthew's Figure).

If we set the drift threshold at zero, then 100% of the area is classified as drift and of 100% of the snow volume would be stockpiled in those drifts, a nonsensical result. But as we increase the threshold these percentages decrease, and at some point the %DA curve begins to decrease more quickly than the %DV curve, andthe difference between the two curves increases (MS Fig). Continuing to increase the threshold, this difference between the %DA and %DV curves reaches a maxiumum and then converge (at 0 %). The point at which the maximum decrease in the difference between DA and DV occurs is where we set the snow depth drift threshold. This inflection point is also the minimum of the second derivative of the probability distribution function for the AOI. In this hypothetical, normally-distributed example, that threshold is also one standard deviation greater than the mean, which has been one informal way we have defined drifts during propr Arctic field campaigns. We use numerical differentiation (NumPy) to compute the snow depth threshold. We have tested the method against numerous visual observations of drifts in the field and find it produces reasonable (and programmable and repeatable) results. The spatial scale of the ROI must be chosen so that it includes a full range of landscape features typical of the area. 

A drift census using the drift criterion descibed above appears in Table ___. On average (both swaths), 19% of the area was drifts, and these contained ~34% of the total snow by volume. From prior work in the ield area drift snow density typically exceeds 0.4g/cm3, while non-drift snow in the same area varies from 0.25 to 0.35 g/cm3. Thus, the drifts are not only deeper, but denser than non-drift areas, which means that over 45% of the snow mass (or SWE) in the study area was contained in drifts during the period of our study.


##### Footnotes
[^1]: Completing the triad, though outside the scope of this paper, is the physical linkage back from snow drifts to topography. In fact, persistent and long-lying snowdrifts can increase the depth and incision of the break in slope that produces a drift through nivation (erosional) processes (REFS). In short, drifts can and do "optimize" the terrain that makes them - a millennial, but very real process.

[^2]: Here we focus on fixed drifts, drifts that are tied to topography, and we disnguish these from bedform drifts like dunes amd barchans (see Filhol and Sturm, 2018).
