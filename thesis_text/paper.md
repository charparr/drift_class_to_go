# Drift Snow Patterns and Topography: An Arctic Investigation

## Abstract

## Introduction
Distinct spatial patterns of snow properties (depth, density, hardness) are common in nature and occur across spatial scales ranging from continental (10<sup>6</sup> m, e.g. snow classes (Sturm et al., 1995)), to regional (10<sup>5</sup> m, e.g. glacier facies (Benson, 1962)), to local (e.g. 10 m snow bedforms). The processes that produce these patterns function over years (climate patterns) to hours, with surprisingly rapid pattern development possible in windy locations where snow transport rates can exceed decigrams/m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>. Not surprisngly, some of the most distinctive snow patterns are found in tundra and prairie snow classes, where wind transport is frequent. These tundra prairie snow patterns reflect the spatial arrangements of two elements (or facies): snow drifts, the "sinks" for windblown snow, and scour zones, the sources.

The snow patterns produced by these elements are important because drifts provide runoff in the summer long after the rest of the snow cover is gone. On the tundra, this delayed runoff occurs when the seasonally frozen ground has thawed, allowing meltwater to infiltrate the soil. Drifts also incrase the overall amount of water storeed across a landscape because once stockpiled in a drift, snow is removed from the transport system and protected from the high sublimation rates that accompanty blowing snow (e.g. up to 47% of the annual snowfall is lost to sublimation (Essery et al., 1999; see also Pomeroy at al., 1997; Listion and Sturm, 1998)). Recent work in the Himalaya (Stigter et al., 2018) indicates a strong anti-coorrelation between the spatial distribution of sublimation magnitude and the distribution of drifts.

In tundra and prairie snow covers the connections between snow, wind transport, and topography are tight (Figure 1), yet surprisingly complex. A key difficulty is that the snow "available" to drift differs from the amount of snow present. That latter amount is the algebraic sum of winter precipitation (*P*) minus (or plus) snow already transported, less sublimated snow (*S*), and less the snow trapped by vegetation (*V*). The amount available for transport is limited by how much is prsent, but also controlled by the wind shear stress, whuch must exceed the surface snow adhesion before transport will occur. Since adhesion varies with sintering, a process affected by snow age, the end result is that predicting the actual flux can be quite difficult even when quality meterological data is present - a condition lacking for much of the windy, snow-covered regions of the Earth. It is not surprising, therefor, that prior studies have docuemented a 10X range in transport rates at any given wind speed (Sturm and Stuefer, 2013).

The relationship between transport and topography (gullies, river cutbanks, hillslopes, ridgelines, etc.) is simpler: snow is deposited wherever the separation angle between wind streamlines and ground slope is sufficient to produce a local reduction in wind shear. The finer details of this relationship are complicated and turbulent, for when wind blows over complex topography eddies, rotors, and turning of the wind occurs. Such wind patterns can be hard to visualize and even harder to model, yet they affect drift geometry. Additionaly, as drifts grow and change through the winter, so do the wind fields around them. Wind-blown snow does not travel the same landscape twice.

But at an even more basic level, we lack fundamental statistical information about drifts and topography. For example, in what sort of topography does the maxiumum proportion of snow accrue in drifts? At watershed, regional, or global scales, how much of the winter snowfall is stockpiled in drifts?[^1] Doest it vary widely with amount of wind and snow?

In this paper, using eight years of aerial photogrammetric and lidar snow depth mapping covering over a hundered square kiolmeters of tundra snow in northern Alaska (Figure 2), we explore the drift-topography relationship (Figure 1) and produce a drift census. Of particular interest is the extent to which the individual drifts take on the same geometry year after year (similarity), and how stable over time existing landscape patterns of scour and drift are likely to be (fidelity). While our study falls short of being a regional census, the results suggest that drifts in this sector of the Arctic can lock up nearly 40% of the snow water equivalent (SWE) each winter and therefore warrant attention.

## Background
Historically, drift studies have taken either a profile or a planimetric perspective. Engineers, faced with preventing rails and roads from being buried by drift (*cf.* Moore, 1922) sought optimal road cut designs, usually prsented in cross section (i.e. profile). Finney (1939), based on a combination of wind tunnel experiments and direct observations, concluded that for slopes greater than 14 degrees wind eddies would form and drift deposition occured. Rikhter (1954) and Kuz'min (1963) explored this topic and drift trap geometry further, and that work culminated in 1975 when Tabler, on the basis of 17 profiles measured in Wyoming and Colorado, developed an empirical drift profile regression model based on upwind and downwind surface slopes. He also introduced the term 'equilibrium profile' to describe the shape of the surface of a snowdrift that cannot grow any further because the deposited snow has filled the catchment and eradicated the separation angle necessary for drifting. Tabler's equilirium and non-equilbirum drifts are analgous to Cornish's (1902) complete vs. incomplete drift classification (defined using profile diagrams) and also equate with the filling or non-filling drifts descbribed by Sturm and Benson (1993). Recognizing (as did Cornish and Tabler) that if a drift was not filled, it could be used to measure the total winter flux, Benson (1981) began an annual series of surveys to monitor drift volume in NW Alaska that has been continued sporadically since then.

The planimetric (mapping) approach has generally been used to understand the distribution and prevalence of drifts on the landscape. Kirnbaur (1991), Konig and Sturm (1998), Grayson et al. (2002), Winstral et al. (2002), and Parajka at al. (2012) all used aerial surveys to map drifts. A few studies (Klapa, 1980; Lauriol et al., 1986; Watson et al., 1994) have tried using aerial photos to conduct a drift census, seeking to use drifts as wind/precipitation climte indicators. Several studies using a plainmetric approach (Luce and Tarboton 2004; Sturm and Wagner, 2010; Qualls and Arogundade, 2013) have attempted to quantify the interannual similarity and fidelity of the drift patterns using map-based approaches.

Combing planimetric and profile appraoches has been hampered by three things. First is the lack of a quantititative definition of what constitutes a drift, which we address later. Second has been the inability to map drift depth when working in the planimetric mode. Until recently, depth has had to be measured manually, limited sample size and extensive drift inventories. Third, we have lacked sophisticated tools for quanitfying drift similarity (or lack thereof).

Fortunately, we can now map drift depths over large areas uing airborne lidar or SfM techniques (REFS), and similar mapping is becoming possible using satellites (REF). More robust methods of comparing spatial similarity have been developed, in large measure due to computer security needs (Jetten, 2003, check REF). In the past, these comparisons have been sensitive to small differences in images, obscuring larger similarities (Wang and Bovik, 2005). Minor geometric distortions and signal noise (common in any remote sensing product) tended to produce low similarity scores (compared to human observers) even when patterns were similiar, but modern algorithms (REFS) have largely rectified this problem.

## Field Area
Each winter between 2012 and 2018 (except 2014) we mapped the snow depth across two swaths of the Kuparuk and Sagavanirktok watersheds of Arctic Alaska (Figure 3).

[^1]: Completing the triad, though outside the scope of this paper, is the physical linkage back from snow drifts to topography. In fact, persistent and long-lying snowdrifts can increase the depth and incision of the break in slope that produces a drift through nivation (erosional) processes (REFS). In short, drifts can and do "optimize" the terrain that makes them - a millennial, but very real process.
